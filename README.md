#LISTER
framework for defining complex UI systems with json

## LISTS
The primary use case for lister is to compose, save, load and modify complex lists through an interactive menu system. Items to add to lists are called Selections and are bound by Rules.
A Lister "list" is really a tree, and each entry in the tree can have its own sublists and subselections.

## Selections
selections are data. 'nuff said.

## RULES
rules offer ways to control how lister menues behave, and how selections are added to lists.
